The Spotify Analysis Power BI Dashboard is designed to provide insights into user listening behavior by analyzing historical streaming data. It focuses on tracking album, artist, and track engagement over time, identifying patterns in music consumption, and comparing trends across different periods. By leveraging Power BI’s interactive capabilities, the dashboard allows for a deeper exploration of how users interact with Spotify’s music catalog.

The analysis includes tracking the total number of albums, artists, and tracks played over various timeframes. It identifies listening behavior differences between weekdays and weekends and highlights the most frequently played albums, artists, and tracks. The dashboard also provides year-over-year growth comparisons, helping to understand shifts in music consumption habits.

A heatmap of peak listening hours helps visualize when users are most active, while a scatter plot analysis categorizes tracks based on frequency and listening duration. Additionally, shuffle and skip rate analysis offer insights into how users interact with songs, indicating levels of engagement and music preferences.

To facilitate deeper analysis, an interactive grid view is included, displaying detailed information about albums, artists, and tracks. The dashboard supports drill-through functionality, allowing users to navigate through the data and explore relationships between different metrics. Users can also export data to CSV for further analysis.

The dataset consists of key attributes such as track metadata, timestamps, device types, and user actions, including shuffle mode usage and track skips. Power BI is used to visualize the data, with DAX calculations enabling advanced analytics and aggregations. 

Overall, this dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Spotify listening patterns, making it a valuable tool for both users and streaming platforms to understand and optimize music engagement.
